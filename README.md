The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.Super class in factory design pattern can be an interface, 
abstract class or a normal java class.
